    <h2>Description:</h2><br>
    <p>If you know someone from Buffalo, they know someone who told them the secret ingredients to the Anchor Bar's famous Buffalo chicken wings. 
        I know people from Buffalo. This is my version of Buffalo sauce, as described to me many years ago, over almost as many beers.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>⅔ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot)</li>
            <li>½ cup cold unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons white vinegar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Combine hot sauce, butter, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, cayenne, garlic powder, and salt in a pot over medium heat. Bring to a simmer while stirring with a whisk.</li>
            <li>As soon as the liquid begins to bubble on the sides of the pot, remove from heat, stir with the whisk, and set aside for use.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
